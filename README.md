# polli

*meaning "`poll i`nterface"*. 


a minimal polling app that's oxidized. mainly a way to learn rust but also minimally useful.

## scuffed roadmap
- cli-based CRUD of polls (including persistence)
- cli-based voting (without any sort of auth lol)
- web-based ui for CRUD/voting (using tokio ecosystem)
- add some poll fraud protection
- advanced poll spam protection&#8482;
- realtime vote updates
